# Tic-Tac-Toe

A modern web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game created for Science Fair 2025.

## Description

This project is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with a clean, modern interface. The game allows two players to take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

## Features

- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Clean, modern UI with a dark theme and teal accents
- Turn-based gameplay between X and O players
- Win detection for all possible winning combinations
- Draw detection when the board is full with no winner
- Game status messages showing current player's turn and game results
- Reset button to start a new game at any time

## How to Play

1. Open the `web.html` file in any modern web browser
2. Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their mark (X or O)
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins
4. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw
5. Click the "Reset Game" button to start a new game at any time

## Technical Details

The game is built using:
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and layout
- JavaScript for game logic and interactivity

No external libraries or frameworks are required, making it lightweight and easy to run.

## Project Structure

- `web.html` - The main HTML file containing the game interface and logic

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Score tracking across multiple games
- AI opponent for single-player mode
- Customizable board size
- Sound effects and animations
- Local storage to save game state
