# Block Blast

A web-based puzzle game created by Jayden for Science Fair 2025.

## Overview

Block Blast is a strategic puzzle game where players place various shaped blocks on a 10x10 grid. The goal is to complete rows and columns to clear them and earn points. The game features drag-and-drop mechanics, random piece generation, and piece rotation for added challenge.

## How to Play

1. **Game Setup**: The game starts with a 10x10 grid and three random pieces available for placement.

2. **Placing Pieces**: 
   - Drag a piece from the pieces container at the bottom of the screen
   - Drop it onto the game board where you want to place it
   - The yellow highlight shows where the piece will be placed

3. **Clearing Lines**:
   - Complete a row or column to clear it
   - When a line is cleared, it disappears and you earn points
   - A white flash effect indicates cleared lines

4. **Scoring**:
   - Each cleared line (row or column) earns 100 points
   - Try to clear multiple lines at once for higher scores

5. **Game Flow**:
   - After placing a piece, it's removed from your available pieces
   - When all pieces are used, three new random pieces are generated
   - Continue until you can no longer place pieces on the board
